-- Complete fix for user_events table
-- Allows events from both authenticated and anonymous users
-- ============================================

-- Make user_id nullable since not all users are Supabase-authenticated
ALTER TABLE user_events ALTER COLUMN user_id DROP NOT NULL;
-- Drop all existing policies to start fresh

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can insert events" ON user_events;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anon can insert events" ON user_events;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role has full access" ON user_events;
-- Create permissive policies for analytics
-- Allow anyone to insert events (authenticated or not)
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can insert events" ON user_events 
  FOR INSERT 
  TO anon, authenticated
  WITH CHECK (true);
-- Allow reading for aggregation and debugging
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can read events" ON user_events

-- Service role full access
