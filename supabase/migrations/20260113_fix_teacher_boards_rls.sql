-- =====================================================
-- FIX RLS POLICIES FOR TEACHER CONTENT TABLES
-- Problem: Policies block upsert when record exists
-- Solution: Separate policies + ensure teacher_id consistency
-- =====================================================
-- Run this in Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor
-- =====================================================

-- First, drop ALL existing policies to start fresh
